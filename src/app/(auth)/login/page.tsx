/**
 * Sign-in as a lit stage rather than a page.
 *
 * The previous version split the screen into a brand band and a white ground
 * with the card straddling the seam. It worked, but the depth was drawn — a
 * shadow standing in for a third dimension that was not there. This version
 * builds the dimension instead: one pointer-tracked light, five planes of
 * parallax behind the subject, and a card that turns to face the cursor with
 * its own contents standing off its face on separate Z planes.
 *
 * Three decisions hold the whole thing together:
 *
 *  · **Espresso in both themes.** This is a brand surface, like the closing
 *    CTA panel on the marketing site. Light and depth need somewhere dark to
 *    happen; a light-mode auth screen would be back to drawing shadows.
 *  · **The card stays themed.** It is the one object here that is *paper* —
 *    the thing you actually work on — so it follows `--card` and keeps its
 *    contrast in both themes while the room around it stays fixed.
 *  · **Restraint carries it.** Six degrees of tilt, sub-20px of parallax,
 *    one light. The scene should be felt before it is noticed; a screen that
 *    announces its animation is a screen that will be turned off by week two.
 *
 * Every effect degrades to a fade under `prefers-reduced-motion`, and the
 * whole pointer layer is inert on touch, where there is no cursor to track and
 * a tilt would only fight the scroll.
