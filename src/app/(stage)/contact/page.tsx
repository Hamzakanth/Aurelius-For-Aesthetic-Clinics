/**
 * Book a walkthrough, staged like sign-in.
 *
 * The old version was a marketing page: site chrome, a light ground, and a left
 * rail of assurances, stats and a pull quote that a phone had to scroll through
 * before reaching the first field. Two problems in one. The form is the page —
 * everything else is there to get someone into it — and a conversion screen
 * that looks nothing like the product it converts into is a seam the visitor
 * can feel even if they never name it.
 *
 * So it moves onto the same stage as `/login`: espresso in both themes, one
 * pointer-tracked light, the argument on the left leaning one way and the form
 * card on the right leaning the other. Both pages now share `PointerStage`,
 * `AuthBackdrop` and the same card physics, and the handoff between them —
 * "no account? book a walkthrough", "already a customer? sign in" — no longer
 * crosses a visual border.
 *
 * On a phone the persuasion collapses: mark, headline, form. The three
 * assurances move underneath, where they answer a hesitation instead of
 * creating one.
